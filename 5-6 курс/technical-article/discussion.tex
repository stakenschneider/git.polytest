\section{Discussion.}

The purpose of this work was to introduce the basics and concepts of deep learning. The biggest problem that can be encountered in the study of deep learning is the cost of equipment.


Since this project is educational, it was decided to study more architecture problems, but rather superficially. In the future, in order to make the course more complete, it was possible to add more theory and increase the number of problems to be solved.


As a result, we have a working system ready for use.
