\section{Results}

The course is designed to be performed with any operating system. To work with textbooks, you need to install Python 3 and Jupyter. The number of third-party libraries is minimized.

The notebooks were designed so that, using their example, students could learn how to extract features from heterogeneous data, what problems there are and how to solve them. They will also learn how to reduce the tasks to the formal statements of the machine learning problem and understand how to check the quality of the constructed model on different data.

Having completed this course, a student can gain knowledge about common types of applied problems and be able to find schemes for solving them.

The course contains three laboratory works that solve problems: classification, localization of images and time series prediction.
